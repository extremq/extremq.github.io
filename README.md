# Introduction
This is my personal website in which I will be posting different articles about various topics I like most. You can read about it on the blog itself, [here](https://extremq.github.io/view/how-i-built-this-site.html).

# How is it done
I am generating a static website using my own interpreter. It can be found in `build.py` and it employs the idea of using components to reuse html snippets (check `src/components`).
