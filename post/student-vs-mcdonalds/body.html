<b>HUGE DISCLAIMER: THEY CAUGHT ME!</b>
<br>
Well, not literally, but they have started using a new fingerprinting system based on the device details. :(
<br>
I didn't give up there. I rooted my phone to be able to spoof my details, but they are reaaally against rooting and have implemented strong checks.
It was fun while it lasted, haha. Damn.
<myhr/>
You're in the 21st century.
<br>
McDonald's reigns supreme above humans as the biggest food chain in the world.
<br>
Students all over the Earth are hungry because algebra consumes a lot of their brainpower.
<br>
<br>
<b>What do you do?</b>
<br>
<br>
If your answer was "Well I'll just go buy a menu from McDonald's or whatever other restaurant there is",
then you obviously are not a student. Since when can students afford food?
<br>
We're living in the capitalist world, mate. You think they would offer meals to people engaged with education for free?
<br>
<br>
ðŸ¤”
<br>
<br>
Well, no. The answer is no. Sorry if I raised your hopes.
<br>
Nobody offers free food for students, especially McDonald's. Big no there.
<br>
<br>
However, that doesn't mean you <i>can't</i> get free food.
It just means they didn't <i>intend</i> you to.
<br>
Get your logic straight. 
<br>
<br>
Alright, without further ado, let me present you <b>THE PLAN</b>.
<br>
<small>â€“ (It is required that any mention of "<b>THE PLAN</b>" must be capitalized and in bold)</small>
<br>
<br>
<b>Introduction.</b>
<br>
This isn't a lousy little offer which let's you eat a bun for free, no. NO.
<br>
With this, you will be able to endlessly order <b>a cheeseburger, small fries</b> and <b>a McChick</b>.
<br>
<small>â€“ A McChick is something regionally exclusive to my country. It is a direct translation of the word "McPuiÈ™or", where "PuiÈ™or" literally means baby chicken, or chick. I also hope they aren't using chicks for that.</small>
<br>
<br>
By continuing to read this, you agree to the fact that you won't EVER tell this to McDonald's.
<br>
I need to eat, you know.
<br>
<br>
<b>Step 1: Find a McDonald's.</b>
<br>
If you're living in Cambodia, Ghana, Montenegro or Yemen, then I am sorry. No restaurants there. :'(
<br>
<br>
<b>Step 2: Register in the McDonald's app.</b>
<br>
PRO TIP: if you use a Gmail address, you can add a + and some random text to fool their system in believing it's a different address.
For example, <kbd>zed@gmail.com</kbd> will be different to <kbd>zed+123@gmail.com</kbd> for McDonald's, but Gmail will send emails to <kbd>zed@gmail.com</kbd> for both addresses. Cool.
<br>
<br>
Here is the registration form:
<myimg(https://i.imgur.com/5xL0c6V.png)/>
Notice the email I am using (and don't worry, I don't care about the email). 
You don't need to fill anything else than this.
<br>
Now, onto the registration code. Here is my Gmail:
<myimg(https://i.imgur.com/VA072T7.png)/>
It sent the email to schrodingur@gmail.com! I fill the code in:
<myimg(https://i.imgur.com/YLvL5zj.png)/>
And that's it.
<myimg(https://i.imgur.com/ogiA8CE.png)/>
Let's check the offers, shall we?
<myimg(https://i.imgur.com/fJVrmma.png)/>
Spot on. GG McDonald's.
<br>
<br>
"But Extremq, where's my fries, dude?!".
<br>
Glad you asked.
<br>
<br>
<b>Step 3: Use the coupons to receive a receipt and claim the free fries.</b>
<br>
To get you up to date, McDonald's usually leaves a code on their receipts for feedback purposes.
If you enter it and complete the form, it will always give you a code for free fries.
Not only that, but they don't care about what you submit or how fast you submit it.
It's so fast (1 minute) I usually complete it while waiting for the order.
<br>
<br>
This is an example (I use Google Lens because I don't want to write anything, I just select the text):
<myimg(https://i.imgur.com/HiHYhR9.png)/>
Yeah, it always messes up the first 0. It thinks it's either an <kbd>o</kbd> or a <kbd>d</kbd>, but who am I to complain?
<br>
<br>
Succesfully completing the form will land you here:
<myimg(https://i.imgur.com/pJHGBrd.png)/>
Here you go. 
<br>
In order to get a code, you need to buy something. 
<br>
However, free things from their app count as buying with a 100% reduction in price, so they give you a code as well.
If you look at this the same way as I do, you'd know that this is basically an endless supply of fries.
<br>
<br>
<b>Step 4: Go to step 2.</b>
<br>
That's right. You don't even have to reinstall the app, just log out of it.
<br>
You have joined the FFF squad (Free Food Forever)!
<br>
<br>
Congratulations, I am so proud of you, reader.
<br>
Here's me preparing to enjoy the process of eating:

<b>Final notes.</b>
<br>
Well, I hope they don't make <b>THE PLAN</b> unavailable.
I really enjoy surviving as a human, especially after university classes.
I promise I will invent something that will help humans, just leave <b>THE PLAN</b> alone.
<br>
<br>
I hope you found this useful or at least funny. It's been a joy documenting this process.
<br>
As always, have a splendid day, reader.
<br>
