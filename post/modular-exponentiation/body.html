Hi there.
<br>
<br>
I heard you wanted to calculate the last digit of \(n = 123456789^{123456789}\). 
<br>
Woah. 
That's a <b>big</b> number.
<br>
<br>
Well then, go ahead and compute all of its \(998952458\) digits. 
The digit you're searching is at the end of the list. 
<br>
Except you're going to get old doing that. 
I don't want you to lose your youth calculating the last digit of \(n\).
<br>
There are other things in life that need your attention, such as <mylink(https://www.google.com/search?q=cat|cats)/>.
<br>
<br>
Let's look at a rather obscure but interestingly useful property of integers.
<br>
<br>
By asking what the last digit of \(n\) actually means trying to compute \(n \text{ mod } 10\).
<br>
Before I show you the formula, I need to talk a bit about <mylink(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function|Euler's totient function)/>.
<br>
<br>
Euler's totient function is denoted with \(\varphi(n)\) and it counts the positive integers up to \(n\) that are relatively prime to \(n\).
<br>
For example,
$$
\begin{equation}
    \varphi(9) = 6
\end{equation}
$$
because
$$
\begin{equation}
    1, 2, 4, 5, 7 \text{ and } 8
\end{equation}
$$
do not share any common divisor with \(9\) except for \(1\).
<br>
<br>
Or, in mathematical terms, \(\text{gcd}(a, 9) = 1\), where \(a \in \{1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8\}\).
<br>
<br>
Other examples are \(\varphi(13) = 12\) and \(\varphi(12) = 4\), just so you get the hang of it – and yes, the totient function of a prime number \(p\) returns \(p-1\).
<br>
<br>
Now that you know what this function is for, let's check out the formula that will be used to aid with our hardships.
<br>
Drum roll, please.
$$
\begin{equation}
    a^b \equiv a^{b \text{ mod } \varphi(c)} \text { mod } c
\end{equation}
$$
If it looks complicated, don't worry. 
What this notation actually implies is the following:
<br>
$$
\begin{equation}
    a^b \text{ mod } c = a^{b \text{ mod } \varphi(c)} \text { mod } c
\end{equation}
$$
I'll just show an example.
<br>
We know that \(3^7 = 2187\). That means its last digit is \(7\), so \(3^7 \text{ mod } 10 = 7\).
<br>
However, using our formula, we can write it as such:
$$
\begin{equation}
    3^7 \text{ mod } 10 = 3^{7 \text{ mod } \varphi(10)} \text { mod } 10
\end{equation}
$$
and that is equivalent to
$$
\begin{align}
    2187 \text{ mod } 10 &= 3^{7 \text{ mod } 4} \text { mod } 10 \\
    &= 3^3 \text { mod } 10 \\ 
    &= 27 \text { mod } 10 \\
    &= 7

\end{align}
$$
That is true.
<br>
<br>
Alright. Feeling the surge of knowledge pouring down your veiny skull?
<br>
I sure do. Let's compute the last digit of \(n=123456789^{123456789}\), once and for all.
<br>
<br>
To begin with, \(\varphi(10) = 4\). Using this, \(123456789 \text{ mod } \varphi(10)\) is simply \(123456789 \text{ mod } 4 = 1\).
<br>
Now, it's trivial – we computed the modified exponent and it resulted to it being \(1\).
<br>
That means:
$$
\begin{align}
    123456789^{123456789} \text{ mod } 10 &= 123456789^1 \text { mod } 10 \\
    &= 123456789 \text{ mod } 10 \\
    &= 9
\end{align}
$$
Who would've guessed?!

You can verify my answer with <mylink(https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=123456789%5E123456789|Wolfram)/>.
<br>
<br>
Before I end it here, I'm going to leave a link to an useful <mylink(https://math.stackexchange.com/a/81240|stackexchange)/> answer on this topic.
However, I'm going to mention that I legitimately haven't seen why \(a\) and \(c\) must be coprime, or \(\text{gcd}(a, c) \neq 1\).
They don't mention <b>why</b>, unfortunately. 
Why am I saying this?
Well, check the first example I gave you.
There, \(a=3\) and \(c=10\). Interestingly, \(\text{gcd}(3, 10) = 1\).
It works.
I won't stop there, though.
<br>
<br>
I've written a python script which computes \(a^b \text{ mod } c\) in both ways and checks if they both return the same value.
Well, I've tested \(a\) and \(c\) as both relatively prime numbers but also as coprimes (in many forms, believe me).
\(b\), the exponent, went from \(1\) to \(10000\) and it never found a wrong answer.
<br>
<br>
I've even tried ranging \(b\) from \(1\) to \(100000\) (and it took a minute to compute), and this is the output.
<pre><code>a = 3
c = 7
b start = 1
b finish = 100000
Correct answers: 99999
Wrong answers: 0
</code></pre>
I'm curious to know why it wouldn't work.
Really, submit any pair of relatively prime numbers and, if you get a wrong answer, send me an issue on <mylink(https://github.com/extremq/extremq.github.io/issues/new/choose|GitHub)/>.
