<h3>Happy new year!</h3>
<br>
Since we are in the 2022'th year of modern history, you should know that the 22th of February will be a palindrome.
<br>
That, if you respect the <mylink(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format_by_country|d/m/y)/> convention. Either way, <b>22.02.2022</b> will be the date, go tell your friends!
<br>
<br>
No need to thank me.

I'm looking forward to <b>starting my gamedev journey</b>.
<br>
It's not my first time using Unity. I've made several games and they all were fun to create.
<br>
<br>
However.
<br>
<br>
I want to build some kind of first person story and that will take a ton of time. The amount of modelling, music, story creation and programming involved... 
<br>
<i>I expect that it will need years.</i>
<br>
At least I am not doing it alone, I've got the artistical support of my one favourite person.
<br>
<br>
I'm going to make use of this blog to keep track of my progress.
Expect pretty much everything from insight into the techniques I am using to showcasing stages of development (think characters, world building, etc.).
<br>
<br>
I've also grew some liking to <b>machine learning</b>. 
I already like the mathematical side of algorithms and data structures (I participated in competitive programming contests) and machine learning seems such a fresh step in a direction I find pleasure in.
<br>
Currently, I am reading <mylink(https://alex.smola.org/drafts/thebook.pdf|this book)/>. It's not a good starter if you aren't accustomed to statistics and programming in general.
<br>
<br>
Alright, let me show you the chess pieces I made to relearn Blender. I'm going to create a small chess game just so I can also relearn Unity and start experimenting with 3D models (you can click on the images, by the way).
