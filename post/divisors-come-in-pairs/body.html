Good day, reader!
<br>
Take a seat. We're talking about divisors.
<br>
<br>
<b>Divisors</b> are an important concept when it comes to number theory. 
They show up a lot when dealing with prime numbers, modulo exponentiation (expect an article about this) and whatever other quirky math algorithms.
<br>
<br>
Some people aren't familiar with a basic <i>yet essential</i> feature about divisors.
Believe me, it also costs a lot of time if you don't know about this, but:
<br>
<br>
<b>Divisors always show up in pairs.</b>
<br>
This means a few things:
<br>
<br>
1. All natural numbers have an even amount of divisors, except for perfect squares (we will see why).
<br>
2. You do not need to cross \(\sqrt{n}\) if you want to retrieve all of \(n\)'s divisors.
<br>
3. You can check if a number is prime without needing to cross \(\sqrt{n}\) (consequence of 2).
<br>
<br>
Let's see why these things hold up.
<br>
<br>
Consider the number \(n = 24\). Its divisors are \(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\).
<br>
Thing is, if we look closer, we can see a pattern:
<br>
<br>
\(1 = 24/24\).
<br>
\(2 = 24/12\).
<br>
\(3 = 24/8\).
<br>
\(4 = 24/6\).
<br>
\(6 = 24/4\).
<br>
\(8 = 24/3\).
<br>
\(12 = 24/2\).
<br>
and,
<br>
\(24 = 24/1\). 
<br>
<br>
But, wait – the clever reader hastily remarks – aren't we repeating ourselves? 
Isn't the first half <i>practically equivalent</i> to the second half?
<br>
<br>
Indeed it is!
<br>
Every divisor \(d\) of \(n\) always has an inverse divisor \(d' = n/d\).
So, as you've seen, when we discover that \(3\) is the divisor of \(24\), we can automatically imply that \(24/3 = 8\) is also a divisor of 24, and it is!
<br>
<br>
When it comes to perfect squares, such as \(9\), we need to make sure we don't count the root twice.
<br>
The divisors of \(9\) are \(1, 3, 9\). 
Using the logic mentioned earlier, we can find \(9\) by dividing by \(1\), but when we get to \(3\) do have some <kbd>if</kbd> clause so you dont add both \(3\) and \(9/3\) as divisors.
<br>
<br>
I do want to think it is obvious now why perfect squares have an odd number of divisors – it's because the root will always be its own pair, thus being the \(1\) in the \(2k + 1\).
<br>
<br>
But why do I not need to cross \(\sqrt{n}\) to know all divisors of \(n\)?
<br>
<br>
Consider the divisor \(d\) of \(n\). 
We will assume that \(d < \sqrt{n}\). 
That is analogous to \(\frac{n}{d} > \sqrt{n}\).
<br>
And if we assume that \(d > \sqrt{n}\), we get that \(\frac{n}{d} < \sqrt{n}\).
<br>
<br>
This means that each pair of divisors will always have a term smaller than the root of \(n\) and one larger.
<br>
Using this, we can simply determine the first half of diviors, smaller than the root, and we're done.
<br>
<br>
Why is this important?
<br>
If we were to compute the divisors of all numbers up to one million, believe me you want to use this property.
The time complexity gets reduced from \(O(n)\) to \(O(\sqrt{n})\). 
It's a big improvement.
<br>
<br>
Lastly, check this proof of concept implemented in C++.

As always, have a wonderful day, reader.
