Greetings!
<br>
<br>
You're probably reading this article because you want to be safe online.
<br>
I'll tell you what steps you should take whenever you come across a link and what to know beforehand.
<br>
<br>
<h1>Why should you know this?</h1>
<br>
Fake links are one of the <b>most popular ways of scamming people</b> online.
<br>
People tell you that you've won a prize, they give you a link and you must log in with some account of yours.
<br>
<br>
But, guess what: the site was a <b>replica</b> and it stole your email and password. 
You probably use the same password for several accounts, so now they will try stealing as many accounts as they can.
<br>
<br>
I don't think you want this to happen, but sometimes you place your trust in the wrong person/company. 
<br>
It's extremely easy to avoid these kinds of scams. Let's see how:
<br>
<br>
<h1>0. Clicking on a link isn't dangerous</h1>
<br>
That's right, it's rule 0, an intro.
<br>
<br>
 If you click on a link and it takes you to a shady website, you can <b>safely close</b> it without any worries.
<br>
However, you <b>should not interact at all</b> with it.
That means typing personal info (passwords, emails), running downloaded files (simply delete them), allowing access to microphone, webcam or notifications, etc.
<br>
<br>
That's the way they scam you.
<br>
<br>
Browsers (such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera) are your friends: make sure you check the top part of your browser each time you click on a link.

Secure site, has a lock.

Unsecure site, lock missing.
<br>
<br>
<H1>1. Always <b>read</b> the link before clicking</H1>
<br>
Why is this so important? Take these three links, for example:
<br>
<code>https://instagarm.com/</code>
<br>
<code>http://instagram.19exta123jae.com/</code>
<br>
<code>https://instagram.io/</code>
<br>
When you click them, all show you the <b>Instagram login</b>, exactly as you expect it.
<br>
<br>
Now, my question is: 
<br>
<b>Which of these links is fake?</b>
<br>
<br>
The correct answer: 
<br>
<b>All of them.</b> The real site is <code>https://instagram.com/</code>.
<br>
<br>
If this wasn't your answer, you could be a <b>potential victim</b>. Let's see why these links are fake.
<br>
<br>
<h1>2. Check for mistakes or similar-looking names</h1>
<br>
The first link I showed you was <code>https://instagarm.com/</code>. Read it, letter by letter.
<br>
<br>
It's intentionally written wrong to look like <i>Instagram</i>, but instead it's <i>Instagarm</i>. 
<br>
This happens a lot:
<br>
<code>https://faecbook.com</code>, <code>https://gmeil.com</code>, <code>https://twittr.com</code>, <code>https://disc0rd.com</code>, etc.
<br>
<br>
Always, always make sure the name is written correctly. 
<br>
<br>
<h1>3. Correctly identify the website name.</h1>
<br>
Website links can take a lot of forms. For example, the site <code>https://facebook.com</code> may use the following:
<br>
<code>https://app.facebook.com</code>,
<br>
<code>https://discover.games.facebook.com</code>,
<br>
<code>https://groups.facebook.com/post/123</code>.
<br>
<br>
They all are part of <code>https://facebook.com</code>. 
<br>
It may be confusing at first, but there's actually a stupidly simple rule:
<br>
<br>
Only the <b>last two words</b> separated by a dot '.', before the first slash '/', if it exists, tell you the website name.
<br>
<i>('https://' and 'http://' do not matter)</i>
<br>
<br>
If you check that with the examples above, you should get <code>facebook.com</code>.
<br>
<br>
If it's hard to remember this, the browser also helps you with this:
<myimg(https://i.imgur.com/arqdbzD.png)/>
The correct website domain stands out with a <b>striking white</b> while the unimportant rest is gray.
<br>
If you remember, I tested you with this link: <code>http://instagram.19exta123jae.com/</code>.
<br>
Using the rule, you should confirm that this site is actually <code>19exta123jae.com</code>, not Instagram.
The browser also supports this:
<myimg(https://i.imgur.com/dudZ25i.png)/>
The <b>striking white part</b> is <code>19exta123jae.com</code>.
<br>
<br>
<h1>4. Check the beginning of the link</h1>
<br>
Sometimes, links start with <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code>.
<br>
<br>
What's the difference? Well, they are the same, except for an extra 's'. It's <B>http</B> and an 's'.
<br>
The extra 's' stands for <b>secure</b> and it means everything you give to the website is protected from other people.
<br>
<br>
Why does this matter? Submitting your password, credit card info or any personal info on a non-secure website is a major threat to your privacy.
<br>
<br>
Avoid sites that start with <b>http</b> and miss the 's' if they ask you for anything personal.
<br>
<br>
Again, browsers tell you when such threat exists:
<br>
Secure sites have a lock, 
<myimg(https://i.imgur.com/PCQCEM0.png)/>
While unsecure sites do not:
<myimg(https://i.imgur.com/fZNTIpn.png)/>
<br>
<br>
<h1>5. Google the website name</h1>
<br>
Sometimes, websites pass all the rules but you still can't trust them.
<br>
<br>
In the last example I gave when I tested you, I asked about <code>https://instagram.io/</code>. 
<br>
Why is this website fake?
<br>
<br>
The '<b>.io</b>' part does not match with '<b>.com</b>'. 
<br>
<br>
I can, for example, create a website called <code>instagram.gg</code>.
<br>
People would not suspect that it's a fake, but the truth is I have no relation with the actual Instagram, so I can fool people into thinking they can trust my website.
<br>
<br>
This is why you should Google the whole name. 
<myimg(https://i.imgur.com/howS2tu.png)/>
Sometimes, they can help you catch the fakes.
<br>
<br>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<br>
The rules are:
<br>
<br>
1. Always read the link before clicking
<br>
2. Check for mistakes or similar-looking names
<br>
3. Correctly identify the website name.
<br>
4. Check the beginning of the link
<br>
5. Google the website name
<br>
<br>
In addition:
<br>
<br>
1. Don't be afraid to open a link, but only give information if you can make sure you can trust it.
<br>
2. Never ever download a file and open it without FULLY trusting the source.
<br>
3. Lastly, don't forget to have fun exploring. Don't be scared to explore the web, but never trust anything without making sure.
<br>
<br>
Hope it helped you learn something new. Be safe, reader.
