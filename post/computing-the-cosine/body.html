Ah, the ancient field of trigonometry. Who would've thought that, after all these centuries, the <i>sine</i> and the <i>cosine</i> functions would be this important?
<br>
Some people probably thought that, but that doesn't matter now.
<br><br>
What matters now is <b>how we compute them</b>.
Since they are so important, people should have figured out smart ways of computing these functions. Of course, we will figure some by ourselves, too.
<br><br>
Reader, arm up. We're going on a math trip.

These are our beloved functions, graphed on a cartesian plane.
<br><br>
You probably heard about the fact that these functions are <b>periodic</b>. What does that mean?
<br>
Well, it means that these functions <b>repeat</b>, and they do so at intervals of \(2\pi\) units. 
<br>
Knowing this, we can formulate the first important property:
<br>
<br>
<h4>Property 1: periodicity</h4>
<myhr/>
\(\sin(x) = \sin(2\pi\cdot\lfloor\frac{x}{2\pi}\rfloor + x\bmod 2\pi) = \sin(x\bmod 2\pi)\)
<br><br>
Here, \(\lfloor x\rfloor\) is the <mylink(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions|floor function)/> and it means taking only the integer part of \(x.\)
<br>
For example, \(\lfloor 2.73\rfloor = 2\).
<br><br>
Then, the <mylink(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation|modulo operation)/>. \(x \bmod y\) retrieves the remainder after calculating the division of \(\frac{x}{y}\).
<br>
For example, \(10.5\bmod 3 = 1.5\) since \(10.5 = 3 * 3 + 1.5\).
<br><br>
All in all, what we have here means that for any \(x\), it is suffice to compute \(\sin(x\bmod 2\pi)\) if we want to know the value of \(\sin(x)\).
<br>
This is the most important property, since it allows us to compute the sine value of huge numbers the same way we do for tiny ones.

<!--\(\sin(x) = \cos(x - \frac{\pi}{2})\) or \(\cos(x) = \sin(x + \frac{\pi}{2})\) (the same exact thing, really).
